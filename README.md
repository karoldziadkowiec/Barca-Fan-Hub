# Barca-Fan-Hub

Project is a website for FC Barcelona's fans. This is the so-called fanpage. This page has detailed information about the club, news, successes, history, and match reports. It has been designed so that fans of this club can keep up to date with information and news about the club. The graphical interface is clear and legible, thanks to which the reader will have no problem finding the information he needs.

Technologies used in the project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The website contains subpages: home page, news, upcoming matches in the current season, team overview, club information, club history.
Additional features of the project: a clock showing the current date and time on the News page, I made an animation on all pages using the jQuery library, which scrolls the page up after pressing the arrow at the bottom of the screen. The arrow at the very top is invisible, it only appears when scrolling down. In the events page I used form controls to send a request. I used also unordered lists and linking to scroll the page faster to the desired place. Social media icons are visible on the footers of the page, after pressing which will redirect the user to the official website of the club.
